## 🧭 Where Your Code Lives in Git

Many people assume that code only lives in two places: GitHub and your local machine. But in reality, Git uses **four key locations** to manage your code:

1. **Working Directory** – This is where you actively write and edit your code on your local machine. Think of it as your development playground.

2. **Staging Area** – A temporary holding area where you place changes before committing. You add files here using `git add`. It’s like preparing your work for submission.

3. **Local Repository** – This is where your commits are saved locally. Using `git commit`, you take a snapshot of what's staged and store it in your personal history.

4. **Remote Repository** – A centralized server (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) where your committed changes can be shared and backed up for collaboration.

## 🔄 Understanding the Git Workflow

Let’s go through the typical journey of your code:

1. **Clone a Repository**  
   Start by cloning an existing repository using `git clone`. This gives you a complete local copy of the project, including its full history.

2. **Edit Files**  
   Make changes in the **Working Directory**—this is your development space.

3. **Stage Changes**  
   Use `git add` to move your changes into the **Staging Area**. This prepares them for a commit.

4. **Commit Changes**  
   Use `git commit` to save the staged snapshot into your **Local Repository**. This creates a permanent record.

5. **Push to Remote**  
   When you're ready to share your changes or back them up, use `git push` to upload your commits to the **Remote Repository**.

6. **Pull Updates from Others**  
   To get updates from your team, use `git pull`. This fetches new changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local code.  
   Under the hood, `git pull` combines `git fetch` (to get updates) and `git merge` (to integrate them).

## 🌿 Working with Branches

Sometimes you need to switch contexts—perhaps to fix a bug or develop a new feature. Git makes this easy with branching:

- **Create a Branch**: `git branch <branch-name>`  
  This creates a new line of development without affecting the main codebase.

- **Switch Branches**: `git switch <branch-name>` or `git checkout <branch-name>`  
  These commands let you jump between different branches.

- **Merge Branches**: `git merge <branch-name>`  
  This integrates changes from one branch into another.

> If changes overlap, you may need to **resolve merge conflicts**—Git will guide you through the process.

Branching enables isolated feature development, quick bug fixes, and smooth collaboration among teams.

# 🔀 2. Git Merge vs. Git Rebase vs. Git Squash (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0chZFIZLR_0)

Both `merge` and `rebase` are used to **integrate changes** from one branch into another. The difference lies in **how** they do it.

## 🔄 Git Merge
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3a7134c-1c33-48bd-b062-4910abdd197e)

### ➤ What it does:
- Combines two branches and **creates a new merge commit**.
- Keeps the **original branch history intact**.
- **Use case:** Incorporate changes from one branch into another
- **How it works:** Creates a **merge commit** to join the histories
- **Analogy:** Ties two ropes together with a knot
- **Pros:** Preserves full history
- **Cons:** Results in a messy history with many merge commits
  
### ➤ Example:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

### ✅ Pros:
- Preserves the actual history and context of changes.
- Safer for **shared/public branches**.

### ❌ Cons:
- History becomes more **cluttered** with merge commits.

### 📈 Example Git History (after merge):
```
A---B---C---F (main)
         \ /
          D---E (feature-branch)
```

---

## 📦 Git Rebase
### add the commits from feature branch into main branch

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/152cd7b0-6c23-4e09-9206-a429d7735558)


### ➤ What it does:
- **Moves the base** of your feature branch to the tip of the target branch.
- **Rewrites commit history** to make it look linear.
- **Use case**: Reapply your feature branch commits on top of the updated main
- **How it works**: Moves the base of your feature branch to the latest commit on main, replaying your commits
- **Analogy**: Rearranges the timeline to appear as a straight line


### ➤ Example:
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

### ✅ Pros:
- Clean, **linear history**.
- Easier to follow when debugging with tools like `git log`.

### ❌ Cons:
- **Rewrites history** – can be dangerous if already pushed to a shared repository.
- Not recommended for **shared branches** unless all team members are coordinated.

### 📈 Example Git History (after rebase):
```
A---B---C---D'---E' (feature-branch rebased onto main)
                   (main)
```

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Feature         | `git merge`                        | `git rebase`                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Commits         | Creates a **merge commit**         | **Rewrites** commit history         |
| History         | Non-linear (branching)             | Linear (looks like one branch)      |
| Use case        | Shared branches                    | Private/local branches              |
| Safety          | Safe for collaboration             | Use with caution (don’t rebase pushed commits) |
| Complexity      | Simple                             | More complex (rewriting history)    |

## 🚨 When to Use What?

- Use **`merge`** when working on **team/shared branches** — it’s safer and maintains full context.
- Use **`rebase`** on **local feature branches** before merging to clean up history.

## 📦Squash Commits
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30c758fb-d234-4091-b15f-280e24d97603)

- **Use case**: Combine multiple feature commits into a single one when merging to main
- **How it works**: Collapses A, B, C into one commit
- **Pros**: Clean history on main, easy to revie
- **Cons**: Loses detailed commit info in main history (though preserved in the feature branch)

````bash
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature
````
